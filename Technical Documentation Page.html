      <p>A computer program is a sequence or set of instructions in a programming language for a computer to execute. Computer programs are one component of software, which also includes documentation and other intangible components.</p>
      <p>A computer program in its human-readable form is called source code. Source code needs another computer program to execute because computers can only execute their native machine instructions. Therefore, source code may be translated to machine instructions using the language's compiler. (Machine language programs are translated using an assembler.) The resulting file is called an executable. Alternatively, source code may execute within the language's interpreter. The programming language Java compiles into an a intermediate form which is then executed by a Java interpreter.</p>
       <p>If the executable is requested for execution, then the operating system loads it into memory and starts a process. The central processing unit will soon switch to this process so it can fetch, decode, and then execute each machine instruction.</p>
       <p>If the source code is requested for execution, then the operating system loads the corresponding interpreter into memory and starts a process. The interpreter then loads the source code into memory to translate and execute each statement. Running the source code is slower than running an executable. Moreover, the interpreter must be installed on the computer.</p>

      <p>Programming language features exist to provide building blocks to be combined to express programming ideals. Ideally, a programming language should: 
        <ul>
          <li>express ideas directly in the code.</li>
          <li>express independent ideas independently.</li>
          <li>express relationships among ideas directly in the code.</li>
          <li>combine ideas freely.</li>
          <li>combine ideas only where combinations make sense.</li>
          <li>express simple ideas simply.</li></ul></p>
        <p>A programming language is a set of keywords, symbols, identifiers, and rules by which programmers can communicate instructions to the computer. They follow a set of rules called a syntax.
         <ul> 
          <li>Keywords are reserved words to form declarations and statements.</li>
          <li>Symbols are characters to form operations, assignments, control flow, and delimiters.</li>
          <li>Identifiers are words created by programmers to form constants, variable names, structure names, and function names.</li>
          <li>Syntax Rules are defined in the Backusâ€“Naur form.</li></ul>
          Programming languages get their basis from formal languages. The purpose of defining a solution in terms of its formal language is to generate an algorithm to solve the underlining problem.An algorithm is a sequence of simple instructions that solve a problem.</p>

      </header>
      <p>Below follow several examples of programming languages.</p>
    </section>
    <section class='main-section' id='FORTRAN'>
      <header>
        <h1>FORTRAN</h1>
      </header>
      <p>FORTRAN (1958) was unveiled as "The IBM Mathematical FORmula TRANslating system." It was designed for scientific calculations, without string handling facilities. Along with declarations, expressions, and statements, it supported:</p>
       <ul>
         <li>arrays</li>
         <li>subroutines</li>
         <li>"do" loops</li></ul>
       <p>It succeeded because:</p>
       <ul>
         <li>programming and debugging costs were below computer running costs.</li>
         <li>it was supported by IBM.</li>
         <li>applications at the time were scientific.</li></ul>
       <p>However, non IBM vendors also wrote Fortran compilers, but with a syntax that would likely fail IBM's compiler. The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) developed the first Fortran standard in 1966. In 1978, Fortran 77 became the standard until 1991. Fortran 90 supports:</p>
        <Ul> 
         <li>records.</li>
         <li>pointers to arrays.</li></ul>
</section>
    <section class='main-section' id='Basic'>
      <header><h1>Basic</h1>
      </header>
      <p>BASIC (1964) stands for "Beginner's All Purpose Symbolic Instruction Code." It was developed at Dartmouth College for all of their students to learn. If a student didn't go on to a more powerful language, the student would still remember Basic. A Basic interpreter was installed in the microcomputers manufactured in the late 1970s. As the microcomputer industry grew, so did the language.
Basic pioneered the interactive session.It offered operating system commands within its environment:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The 'new' command created an empty slate.</li>
        <li>Statements evaluated immediately.</li>
        <li>Statements could be programmed by preceding them with a line number.</li>
        <li>The 'list' command displayed the program.</li>
        <li>The 'run' command executed the program.</li></ul>
      <p>However, the Basic syntax was too simple for large programs. Recent dialects added structure and object-oriented extensions. Microsoft's Visual Basic is still widely used and produces a graphical user interface</p>
    </section>
    <section class='main-section' id='C'>
      <header><h1>C</h1>
      </header>
      <p>C programming language (1973) got its name because the language BCPL was replaced with B, and AT&T Bell Labs called the next version "C." Its purpose was to write the UNIX operating system. C is a relatively small language, making it easy to write compilers. Its growth mirrored the hardware growth in the 1980s. Its growth also was because it has the facilities of assembly language, but uses a high-level syntax. It added advanced features like:</p>
      <ul>
       <li>inline assembler.</li>
       <li>arithmetic on pointers.</li>
       <li>pointers to functions.</li>
       <li>bit operations.</li>
       <li>freely combining complex operators.</li></ul>
      <p>C allows the programmer to control which region of memory data is to be stored. Global variables and static variables require the fewest clock cycles to store. The stack is automatically used for the standard variable declarations. Heap memory is returned to a pointer variable from the <code>malloc()</code> function.</p>  
      <p>C provides the <code>malloc()</code> library function to allocate heap memory. Populating the heap with data is an additional copy function. Variables stored in the heap are economically passed to functions using pointers. Without pointers, the entire block of data would have to be passed to the function via the stack.</p>

    <section class='main-section' id='C++'>
      <header><h1>C++</h1>
      </header>
      <p>In the 1970s, software engineers needed language support to break large projects down into modules. One obvious feature was to decompose large projects physically into separate files. A less obvious feature was to decompose large projects logically into abstract datatypes. At the time, languages supported concrete (scalar) datatypes like integer numbers, floating-point numbers, and strings of characters. Concrete datatypes have their representation as part of their name. Abstract datatypes are structures of concrete datatypes, with a new name assigned. For example, a list of integers could be called integer_list.</p>
      <p>In object-oriented jargon, abstract datatypes are called classes. However, a class is only a definition; no memory is allocated. When memory is allocated to a class, it's called an object. Object-oriented imperative languages developed by combining the need for classes and the need for safe functional programming. A function, in an object-oriented language, is assigned to a class. An assigned function is then referred to as a method, member function, or operation. Object-oriented programming is executing operations on objects.
     <p>Object-oriented languages support a syntax to model subset/superset relationships. In set theory, an element of a subset inherits all the attributes contained in the superset. For example, a student is a person. Therefore, the set of students is a subset of the set of persons. As a result, students inherit all the attributes common to all persons. Additionally, students have unique attributes that other persons don't have. Object-oriented languages model subset/superset relationships using inheritance. Object-oriented programming became the dominant language paradigm by the late 1990s.</p>
     <p>C++ (1985) was originally called "C with Classes." It was designed to expand C's capabilities by adding the object-oriented facilities of the language Simula.
An object-oriented module is composed of two files. The definitions file is called the header file. Here is a C++ header file for the GRADE class in a simple school application:</p>
      <code>
        // grade.h
// -------

// Used to allow multiple source files to include
// this header file without duplication errors.
// ----------------------------------------------
#ifndef GRADE_H
#define GRADE_H

class GRADE {
public:
    // This is the constructor operation.
    // ----------------------------------
    GRADE ( const char letter );

    // This is a class variable.
    // -------------------------
    char letter;

    // This is a member operation.
    // ---------------------------
    int grade_numeric( const char letter );

    // This is a class variable.
    // -------------------------
    int numeric;
};
#endif
      </code>
      <p>A constructor operation is a function with the same name as the class name. It is executed when the calling operation executes the new statement.

A module's other file is the source file. Here is a C++ source file for the GRADE class in a simple school application:</p>
      <code>// grade.cpp
// ---------
#include "grade.h"

GRADE::GRADE( const char letter )
{
    // Reference the object using the keyword 'this'.
    // ----------------------------------------------
    this->letter = letter;

    // This is Temporal Cohesion
    // -------------------------
    this->numeric = grade_numeric( letter );
}

int GRADE::grade_numeric( const char letter )
{
    if ( ( letter == 'A' || letter == 'a' ) )
        return 4;
    else
    if ( ( letter == 'B' || letter == 'b' ) )
        return 3;
    else
    if ( ( letter == 'C' || letter == 'c' ) )
        return 2;
    else
    if ( ( letter == 'D' || letter == 'd' ) )
        return 1;
    else
    if ( ( letter == 'F' || letter == 'f' ) )
        return 0;
    else
        return -1;
}</code>
      <p>Here is a C++ header file for the PERSON class in a simple school application:</p>
      <code>// person.h
// --------
#ifndef PERSON_H
#define PERSON_H

class PERSON {
public:
    PERSON ( const char *name );
    const char *name;
};
#endif</code>
